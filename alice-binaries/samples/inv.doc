			 ---------------

	  Alice Inventory is a sample program to demonstrate  the
capabilities  of  Alice:  The  Personal  Pascal.   It will run on
version 1.3 or later.  It can not, unlike most Alice programs, be
compiled with Turbo Pascal, as it uses a number of Alice features
(such as menus) that are not part of Turbo Pascal.

Running Alice Inventory
-----------------------

	  To run the Alice Inventory program start up the Alice
Pascal programming environment and load the file INV.AP.  You can
now  edit,  examine  and modify the program as you wish, and then
run it by pressing F1.

Do NOT hit Control-Z or F6 to generate an end-of-file while Alice
Inventory  is  waiting for input.  Alice Inventory does not check
for an end-of-file condition from the terminal and  thus  a  run-
time error will result from hitting F6 or Control-Z.

Hitting Break during execution may result in an  incomplete  file
update.   If  you suspect that this has happened, select the file
compression option (see below) as this will restore all the  data
in the control file.


Using Alice Inventory
---------------------


	  When you start Alice Inventory for the first  time,  it
will  create  the  inventory  file  and  the control file on your
current disk.  These files, SAMPLE.INV and SAMPLE.CTL (the  names
may  be  changed  by  modifying a constant in the program) should
then always be on your current disk when you run Alice  Inventory
the subsequent times.

Whenever you start  Alice  Inventory,  it  will  check  that  the
inventory  and  control  files  exist  on  the  current  disk and
directory.  If one or both  do  not  exist,  the  files  will  be
initialized.

	  After the startup screen, Alice Inventory will  display
the  main  menu  on  the  screen.   The  main  menu provides five
functions, which are described in detail below:


     1. Update operations

     Making this selection will replace the main  menu  with  the
     update menu.

     The update menu choices are explained below:
	  1.1 return to previous menu
	  This will return the main menu on the screen.

	  1.2 Retrieve item
	  This will retrieve all  the  information  for  a  given
	  inventory item from the inventory file.

	  1.3 Add item
	  This will  allow  adding  of  items  to  the  database.
	  Initially, the database is empty, and you must add some
	  inventory  items  prior  to  being  able   to   perform
	  reporting or retrieval operations.

	  1.4 Change item price
	  This will permit price changes to  a  given  item.   In
	  order  to change the item code (referred to as 'key' in
	  the program) the item must be deleted and re-inserted.

	  1.5 Delete item
	  This will delete an item from the  inventory  database.
	  Note that the spaced used by the item is not recovered.
	  In order to recover the space freed by  deletions,  you
	  must perform a compression on the inventory database.


     2. Database operations

     This will replace the main menu with the database menu.  The
     database   menu  has  a  number  of  operations,  which  are
     described in detail below:

	  2.1 Return to previous menu
	  This will return to the main menu.

	  2.2 Display inventory items
	  This will display all the database items on the screen.
	  The  display  includes the item code, item description,
	  quantity on hand, quantity on order  and  number  sold.
	  For more detailed output, select the inventory report.

	  2.3 Print inventory report
	  This will print a report of all the inventory items  on
	  the  screen.   The report contains two detail lines for
	  each  item,  and   includes   the   item   code,   item
	  description,  quantity  on  hand,  quantity  on  order,
	  number sold to date, purchase cost, selling  price  and
	  dollar sales to date.  The total dollar amount of sales
	  is also printed at the end of the report.

	  2.4 Compress inventory database
	  This allows recovery of  space  freed  by  deletion  of
	  inventory  items.   It  also allows changing of maximum
	  inventory size  (by  changing  the  hash  table  size).
	  Default maximum size is 500 items.

	  2.5 Initialize inventory database
	  This will initialize the inventory database  and  ERASE
	  ALL  ITEMS  IN  INVENTORY.   Do not use this operation
	  unless you really do want to erase everything!


     3. Sell an item

     This will record a sale.  A sale consists  of  one  or  more
     copies  of  ONE  item.  If multiple items are sold, multiple
     sale transactions must be made. If there is  not  sufficient
     stock  to cover the transaction, the system will ask whether
     an order should be placed to cover the  remainder.   If  so,
     the quantity on order is increased appropriately.  note that
     the items ordered are not yet considered sold.

     You can also accept returns of an item.  to do this,  select
     the  'sell' action as above, and enter the quantity returned
     as a negative number (i.e. -5 for five returned items).


     4. Add to stock

     This will record the arrival of an order.  the  quantity  on
     hand  is  increased  by  the  amount  of  the order, and the
     quantity on order is reduced by the  same  amount  (although
     never to less than zero).  As above, returns to supplier can
     be entered as negative entries.


     5. Quit

     This will terminate the the program, after first  completing
     any updates, and return you to either the Alice editor or to
     DOS (depending on where you  started  the  execution).   You
     should  never  hit  Break  to quit as this may result in the
     corruption of your inventory.


     Good luck!
