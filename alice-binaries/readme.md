In these files you will find the complete ALICE: The Personal Pascal
System.  This system, developed for MS-DOS in 1985, is still
an excellent student's introduction to programming.   While you may
find the character based interface hard to learn compared to today's
mouse based systems, the program still works fine.

In the main directory is the "Small" ALICE which was meant for the
limited memory (256K) machines of the day.  You may prefer the version
in the subdirectory named "large" if your work gets serious.  The
small version is limited to programs 128K in size.

Simply unpack the archive and you can run ALICE right in its directory.
The initialization file, help file and structure template files are
all there.  The program was split onto 2 360K disks -- today that seems
pretty silly.

In modern times, after the rights to this program reverted, I decided
to let it out as freeware.  Copy it and give it away as you like.  The
help files, which I've lost the building tools for, still indicate it is
a commercial program but you can ignore them.

With that in mind, I am absolutely unavailable to provide tech support.
This is the price of using old software after its lifetime -- no support
is available.  If I get calls for support, it will send a message not to
release such things free.

Which means you must stick to the help files.  The published manuals are
available on the web -- check http://www.templetons.com/brad/alice.html
The textbook is out of print and its source is gone
